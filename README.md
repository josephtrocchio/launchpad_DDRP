# Launchpad for Django, Django REST Framework, and Postgres
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to have a pre-configured backend for future software and web application development.
The idea is to dockerize django's backend/ORM/admin with a Postgres database attached, and pre-install all the necessary
dependecies to get a quick software up and running.

## How it works
After installing docker on your machine it is as simple as running the container image. 

## My focus on this project
My focus is to create a dynamic approach to future projects having intensive database and usern requirements

## Technologies I'm using
- Docker :whale:
- Python :snake:
- Django :newspaper:
- Django REST Framework :boom:
- Postgres :elephant:
- Gunicorn :unicorn:

## Future Ideas
I will hopefully work towards creating a launchpad for a dynamic front end with React, html, and CSS.
